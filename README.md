### JSX Xpress - News Feeder

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The app will use your IP Address to identify your default country and the latest news in such categories:  "business", "entertainment", "food", "health", "politics", "science", "sports", "technology", "top", "tourism", "world".

The headlines of the latest news will be displayed in the app. Users can scroll down infinitely to read the headlines. When users click the headlines, the app will display the content and the link to the original source of the article.

The app allows users to search via a search box or change to a specific country to get the latest news of the selected country.

The app uses the API from [News Data] (https://newsdata.io/documentation).

Limitation:

Due to the limitation of FREE ACCOUNT. The App only works the latest news. The latest news would have access in only 48 hours.

** Screenshots can be seen on the screenshots folder.
