            "content": "Limbo previously left Game Pass back in June 2022, but the beloved puzzle platformer has now returned to Xbox Game Pass , PC Game Pass, and Xbox Cloud Gaming. Limbo now available with Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass In Limbo, you play as a young boy who sets out on a dark and treacherous journey where you will need to navigate dangerous traps, avoid deadly enemies, and solve puzzles in an attempt to find out what happened to your sister. Limbo is often cited as one of the best puzzle platformers available, thanks to its clever puzzles and creepy, foreboding atmosphere that runs through the entire game. With its return to the service, Limbo is easily one of the best games on Game Pass , and it's definitely worth checking out if you haven't played it already. Most of the Limbo achievements are pretty straightforward to unlock (a completion is estimated to take around eight hours), though the No Point in Dying achievement will cause a few headaches for sure. There is also a Windows version of Limbo with its own separate achievement list . There are still several games coming to Game Pass in August, including Sea of Stars, Everspace 2, and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.",

            "description": "The opposition said it was concerned about poor consultation with pharmacies but will need the full crossbench to block the change after the Greens ruled it out.",
            "content": "A popular budget measure to halve the price of common medicines will face a last-ditch challenge in the senate as the Coalition moves to block 60-day prescriptions and force Health Minister Mark Butler back to the negotiating table with pharmacies. But the opposition faces an uphill battle getting the full crossbench onside, after the Greens broke their silence on the issue to swing in behind the government on the last sitting day of parliament before the policy takes effect on September 1. The policy would allow patients to receive 60-day scripts from September, with the same maximum co-payment of $30. Credit: Michele Mossop Butler said the upper house had 24 hours from Wednesday afternoon to decide on the future of 60-day scripts as he threatened to cancel expedited negotiations about pharmacy funding , after Coalition health spokeswoman Anne Ruston said she would move a disallowance motion to block the reform on Thursday. Labor’s budget policy will effectively halve the price of 320 common medicines for consumers by allowing them to buy two months of medicine for the price of one . But pharmacy owners have said they will be forced to close or cut services as they lose income from the reduced handling and dispensing fees they receive from the government. Ruston said the Coalition supported 60-day dispensing, but wanted to delay the start date because the government had not properly consulted pharmacies on the change nor considered the flow-on effects on their businesses. However, the disallowance motion will struggle to succeed after the Greens confirmed within an hour of the Coalition’s announcement it would back the government, having refrained from declaring its position for weeks. Loading Without the Greens, the Coalition needs an outright majority that includes the whole crossbench. One Nation and independent senator David Van have put their names to the disallowance motion, and Senator Tammy Tyrrell has been vocal in criticising the policy. However, Senator David Pocock has not declared a position and Senator Jacqui Lambie this week said she was worried about pharmacy lobby scare campaigns. The Coalition’s decision follows a fierce campaign from the influential Pharmacy Guild of Australia , which has been lobbying the opposition, Greens and crossbench senators to delay the policy. Butler said the disallowance needed “to be dealt with quickly” since 60-day scripts are due to start on September 1. “The Senate now has a choice over the next 24 hours: either allow access to cheaper medicines for 6 million Australians as recommended by the medicines experts, as supported by every patient and doctor group, or accept the position of the Coalition and the pharmacy lobby, that cheaper medicines should not be proceeded within this country,” he said. Loading Greens health spokesman Jordon Steele-John previously told parliament he was concerned about pharmacy viability. But on Wednesday he said the 60-day policy would help disabled and chronically ill people by allowing them to take fewer trips to the pharmacist. The government has committed to reinvesting the $1.2 billion it saves from dispensing fees into a range of measures including opioid dependence treatment, vaccinations and regional pharmacy allowances. Butler said those promises, as well as early funding negotiations, would be off the table if the policy was blocked. Pharmacies say the government’s package does not cover their full losses , including from consumer payments, which they put at $4.5 billion. Ruston said there were “legitimate concerns” about the policy’s implementation which could force local businesses to close. Anne Ruston said the policy could force local pharmacies to close. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen “[We’re asking the government] to please just push pause on the instrument that will bring in 60-days of dispensing, and go back to the table and deal with the consequences,” Ruston said. “Otherwise, there will be significant and foreseeable risks for Australians who need support, particularly people in rural and regional communities, aged care residents, and patients with chronic diseases.” Ruston said she instead wanted 60-day scripts incorporated into the next Community Pharmacy Agreement, which deals with overall pharmacy funding. The agreement is up for renewal in 2025, but she said it could be renegotiated and expedited to start in January 2024. Loading Butler earlier this week vowed to bring pharmacy funding negotiations forward by a year in an attempt to placate concerned crossbench senators. On Wednesday, he said he was open to bringing forward the start date of the next agreement as well. “But we’re not going to lock ourselves into a rigid, short timeframe. That’s not a good position in which to negotiate with taxpayers money,” Butler said. Steele-John said he wanted Butler to commence negotiations with the pharmacy sector in good faith and “implement an updated agreement that prioritises measures to support the community’s access to community pharmacies”.

            "description": "With cruise bookings seeing a resurgence after the COVID pandemic caused luxury liners to mothball, a Finnish shipyard is putting the final touches on what will be the world's largest cruise ship.",
            "content": "August 9, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread With cruise bookings seeing a resurgence after the COVID pandemic caused luxury liners to mothball, a Finnish shipyard is putting the final touches on what will be the world's largest cruise ship. Royal Caribbean's luxurious new vessel Icon of the Seas is nearing completion in the Turku shipyard on Finland's southwestern coast, its maiden voyage scheduled for January 2024. \"This ship is as of today, as far as we are aware of, the biggest cruise ship in the world,\" said Tim Meyer, CEO of shipbuilder Meyer Turku tasked with the construction. While some have labeled the colossal structure a \"monstrosity\", citing its vast climate footprint, others are in awe of the sophisticated engineering integrated into this floating holiday destination and flocking to buy tickets. Resembling a village more than a ship, the mammoth vessel boasts colorful waterparks, more than 20 decks and can carry nearly 10,000 people. A distinct feature of the new ship, which went into construction in 2021 and entered sea trials in June, is a gigantic glass dome that covers part of its front section. The pandemic dealt a heavy blow to the industry, raising questions about whether it would ever recover. Cruise companies are now seeing customers return. The Cruise Lines International Association has predicted that passenger volume will surpass pre-pandemic levels with 31.5 million passengers in 2023. \"After the restrictions are gone and the situation has eased up, we are seeing that the market is coming back very strong,\" Meyer said. With a gross tonnage of 250,800—five times the size of the Titanic—Icon of the Seas will snatch the title of the world's largest cruise ship from Royal Caribbean's current flagship, Wonder of the Seas. Meyer Turku also has two more similar sized Icon-class vessels in their order books. \"We have seen over the last decade that cruise ships have become bigger,\" said Alexis Papathanassis, professor of Cruise Management at Bremerhaven University of Applied Sciences. Papathanassis noted that \"there are obvious economic benefits\" to mega-sized ships, reducing the cost of individual passengers. With its seven pools, a park, waterslides, shopping promenades, ice skating rink and \"more venues than any other ship\", larger vessels like the Icon of the Seas also offer more options for spending money on board. This \"in turn enables cruise companies to be more profitable,\" he added. The extra income is welcomed by the cruise lines—in order to survive COVID lockdowns the cruise lines \"had to take a lot of credit\" they now have to pay back. \"It's going to be a challenging time with financial austerity for cruise companies,\" Papathanassis said, adding that he expected ticket prices to rise. While \"the tendency towards increasing the size of the ship is not going to stop\", Papathanassis believes \"it will certainly be slowed down\". The reason behind this is not engineering but rather the financial equation. \"The bigger the ships are, the higher the investment cost and the required technology know-how. And technological know-how does not come cheap,\" Papathanassis explained. Similarly, larger vessels come with their own unique challenges, such as port overcrowding, he noted. As passenger numbers have grown, popular cruise destinations like the modest Arctic town of Longyearbyen in Norway's Svalbard archipelago, for example, have voiced concern over the lack of infrastructure to accommodate such large crowds. Moreover, as cruise companies aim to increase passenger capacity, they also reduce the ratio of crew to passengers, which can pose challenges in case of unexpected events. \"Regarding accidents or crises onboard, with larger ships it's a much greater challenge to take care of the evacuation,\" Papathanassis explained. From a climate perspective, some argue that one large ship is more energy efficient than several small ones. But others disagree. \"If we followed that logic, we would be building bigger cruise ships, but less of them,\" argued Constance Dijkstra, Shipping Campaigner at the NGO Transport & Environment (T&E). \"But that's not what's happening. We are witnessing more and more vessels that are bigger than ever.\" And while modern ships are taking steps to mitigate emissions with technology—the Icon of the Seas will run on liquified natural gas (LNG)—environmentalists are not convinced. Often hailed as a bridge towards more climate-neutral options, LNG has lower emissions than traditional marine fuels, but T&E has voiced concern over potential methane leaks. \"LNG does have dramatic consequences for the climate because it leaks methane,\" Dijkstra said. A typical component of LNG, methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that can have a much worse impact on the climate than carbon dioxide. \"The problem is when you use LNG as a marine fuel, you are encouraging the development of the gas industry.\" © 2023 AFP",

            "description": "NSW’s longest-serving premier is reigniting the squabble over prized green space in the city’s densely populated eastern suburbs.",
            "content": "Sydney’s green fairways are increasingly being eyed as fair game to satisfy the need for more public open space in densely populated areas. None more so than Moore Park Golf Course in the eastern suburbs, which City of Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore has for years declared should be chopped in half to create more parkland for nearby apartment dwellers. Now NSW’s longest-serving premier, Labor’s Bob Carr , has weighed into the debate, arguing the tens of thousands of residents destined for the area are entitled to expect that local and state governments provide ample public parks. Chipping out of the rough: former premier Bob Carr wants a rethink of Moore Park Golf Course. In a move sure to (again) ruffle the city’s golfing enthusiasts, Carr is pushing for the proposals to rework part or all of the 45-hectare golf course to be placed on exhibition to reignite public debate. “There are eight golf courses running between the city and Botany Bay, and the only way we’ll get new parkland is by converting Moore Park,” Carr, who is not a golfer, told this column. “Given the towers that have transformed this part of Sydney, and a doubling of their number on the way, we desperately, desperately, desperately need a big, generous dollop of public open space.” Moore’s plans to shrink the course from 18 holes to nine have been stuck in the rough since former Coalition planning minister Rob Stokes kiboshed the idea following backlash from golfers and the club. Loading Carr would not be drawn on whether he had lobbied Premier Chris Minns’ government – which has emphasised the need to increase housing density in the inner city – but said: “I’m an advocate, I’ll talk to anyone with an interest in it.” City of Sydney Liberal councillor Lyndon Gannon , a self-described “whacker” who occasionally plays at Moore Park, also reckons the 18-hole course should stay. “It’s a slippery slope, if you start to subdivide golf courses, like they tried to do at Marrickville [golf club], where does it stop?” A spokeswoman for Planning and Public Spaces Minister Paul Scully said the former premier had presented some ideas that he and Moore had for “re-wilding” the Moore Park fairways. “Currently there is no formal proposal to make changes,” the spokeswoman said. Moore Park Golf Club president John Janik suggested transforming vacant blocks rather than the “already green” public golf course, into parkland. “How does rewilding an existing green space create more green space for apartment living?” Developers in Melbourne have recently argued disused and struggling golf courses could be a ready-made fix to the housing crisis. Carr, however, was quick to dash any ideas of building homes on converted golf courses. “Every square metre must be public open space,” he said. Rudd the ‘selfie’ king switches to portrait mode Kevin Rudd is taking a break from ambassadorial duties in Washington to unveil his official portrait in Canberra on Thursday. Kevin Rudd was in no rush to be immortalised. Credit: Illustration: John Shakespeare. All former prime ministers are hung in Parliament House’s Historic Memorials Collection and, true to form, Rudd called in the big guns: the Royal Family’s go-to portraitist, Ralph Heimans . The Australian’s gigantic painting of Queen Elizabeth II to mark her Diamond Jubilee hangs permanently in Westminster Abbey; he also painted the late Prince Philip in 2017 and Charles III in 2018. Quite the CV. Heimans also happens to be the brother of Jeremy Heimans , co-founder of GetUp!, the activist group which conservatives have attacked as a Labor front ever since it mobilised voters to help Rudd defeat John Howard at the 2007 election. Kevin Rudd was in Canberra on Wednesday ahead of the unveiling of his portrait. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Rudd was spotted in parliament on Wednesday having coffee with Jim Chalmers , and was welcomed back to the building by the people that matter most, including getting a great big hug from one of parly’s longest-serving cleaners, Anna Jancevski . The former PM was overheard joking with colleagues that he hasn’t been in any rush to have his portrait painted. Next month will indeed mark a decade since he lost the top job – the second time that is, via an election, not his colleagues – and two successors are already up in the gallery. Julia Gillard presented her photo-realistic portrait by Vincent Fantauzzo (husband of Gold Logie-winner Asher Keddie ) in 2018 – five years after Rudd replaced her as PM. Tony Abbott visited Parliament last November – seven years after his term ended – to unveil a masculine likeness by The Australian ’s acrid cartoonist Johannes Leak , whose late father Bill painted Bob Hawke for the collection. CBD gathers Malcolm Turnbull ’s portrait is close to being formally commissioned, and must assume the noted art collector will be discerning in his choice of painter. Archibald Prize-winner Lewis Miller was working on a portrait of the future PM back in 1994 but – in a fantastic yarn spun by the late, legendary Sydney art dealer Ray Hughes – he cut it to shreds when Turnbull complained it made him “look like a big, fat, greedy c---” . Turnbull has always said the tale wasn’t true. Virgin faces uphill battle to get ‘unhappy’ staff on side before sale Virgin Australia is heading for a turbulent time as its owner Bain Capital prepares to offload the airline in an IPO. The Boston private equity behemoth picked up Virgin after COVID sent it bankrupt in 2020, and parachuted in ex-Jetstar boss Jayne Hrdlicka as CEO. Bain has already made its money back after paying itself $730 million in cash in May, so it’s all juicy profit for the crew led by former Olympic diver Mike Murphy from here. Virgin is pushing to settle a new pay deal with pilots early, which insiders believe is an attempt to lock in its cost base before pitching it to new investors. It also gets potential strikes out of the way. But getting Virgin’s staff on side will be an uphill battle if a recent internal employee survey CBD has obtained is anything to go by. Just under one-in-five flight operations staff said they “rarely” think about looking for a new job somewhere else, and less than 5 per cent would recommend Virgin to family and friends as a “great place to work”. Loading A whopping 95 per cent of crew think they’re not paid fairly – unsurprising after they accepted tough conditions to help the company out of bankruptcy – and only 30 per cent said they “feel proud” to work for the airline. Sentiment has improved across the board since last year’s survey, but as flight operations boss Alex Scamps told staff in an email last week, “there is no pretending they reflected where we want to be as a business”. Negotiating new Enterprise Bargaining Agreements early was the best way to address workers’ “remuneration, flexibility and lifestyle concerns”, Scamps told them. A company spokesperson also told us new pay agreements would help it build a sustainable business where employees feel valued and recognised and had nothing to do with an IPO. But cheering up this unhappy bunch will be expensive, and strike-prone unions will be pushing hard. How that aligns with Bains’ plans to dress it up for sale is yet to be seen.

            "content": "August 9, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Holmes CHAN Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific on Wednesday swung to a healthy profit in the first half of the year thanks to a pick-up in travel, with the airline expecting passenger capacity to reach 70 percent of pre-pandemic levels by end of the year. The airline said it made a $546 million profit in January-June, rebounding from a loss of $640 million in the same period last year. It also suffered big losses in the first six months of 2020 and 2021 as the city was battered by coronavirus travel restrictions. Chairman Patrick Healy said Cathay had \"worked to rebuild connectivity at the Hong Kong international aviation hub following the full reopening of borders in Hong Kong\" and in mainland China. The airline has been making \"good progress\" in adding flights and destinations between January and June, which was a \"positive period\", Healy added in the exchange filing. \"While we are still only part way along our rebuilding journey, our results for the first six months of 2023 demonstrate that we are on the right track,\" he said. He added that Cathay would hit its target of \"70 percent pre-pandemic passenger flight capacity levels... by the end of 2023\". \"We are confident of reaching 100 percent by the end of 2024.\" Cathay carried a total of 7.8 million passengers in the first half of the year, bringing in $3.2 billion. Total revenue—including cargo and other services—more than doubled year-on-year to $5.6 billion. But weaker overseas demand meant the cargo unit's revenues dropped 11.6 percent to $1.4 billion. Hong Kong last year belatedly abandoned its \"zero-COVID\" policy, which imposed strict rules on travelers and kept the city internationally isolated for two and a half years—tanking the finance hub's economy. The airline has struggled to catch up to regional rivals such as Singapore Airlines, and is racing to rebuild its capacity amid a manpower crunch. Healy said at a Wednesday press briefing that Cathay was still behind its rivals as it began recovery from an \"incredibly low base\". \"We started later but the trajectory of that recovery, when compared with... the starting point of our key regional competitors, is absolutely on track (and) in some cases faster,\" Healy said. Cathay earlier said it would recruit more staff from China and increase the number of Mandarin-speaking flight attendants after allegations of discrimination against mainland Chinese passengers. Chief operations and service delivery officer Alex McGowan said at the Wednesday briefing that the airline was targeting to hire around 200 to 300 cabin crew from mainland China, with recruitment underway. Cathay also saw the return of around 250 pilots who had left during the pandemic, McGowan said. \"We did see an elevated turnover of pilots during a very difficult period of the pandemic... That turnover has now been back at normal levels for some time,\" he added. The airline also announced it will bolster its fleet by purchasing 32 Airbus A321neo and A320neo aircraft, to be delivered by 2029. Only around 25 idle Cathay planes remain parked in the Australian desert—a storage method adopted during the pandemic—and all are expected to be returned by the second quarter next year. Cathay also said that before year-end it plans to buy back 50 percent of preference shares it issued to the Hong Kong government in 2020 after receiving a $5 billion bailout to keep it afloat during the pandemic. The buyback for the remaining shares is set to be completed by July 2024. © 2023 AFP",

            "content": "There are hopes that a collective bargaining agreement could be finalised by the end of the week after breakthrough talks were held between the NRL and the players’ union. The Rugby League Players’ Association and the NRL spent most of Wednesday in talks, the first time the parties have been at the negotiating table in months. NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo, ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys, RLPA chief executive Clint Newton, RLPA chairman Deidre Anderson and other representatives from both sides spent five hours thrashing out the sticking points. The stakeholders are scheduled to meet again on Thursday, raising hopes that the long-running dispute could soon be resolved. “It was a very positive meeting,” V’landys said. “If that continues, which I’m confident it will, we will come to a resolution.” The RLPA, which initially pushed for an industrial relations mediator to settle the dispute, was contacted for comment. Negotiations, which have been ongoing for 20 months, had ground to a halt before Wednesday. The RLPA tried to kick-start talks again by limiting the players’ interaction with the media and covering up the NRL logo during games, although the latter action lasted just one round of football. ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys.

            "content": "BMW has revealed the latest iteration in its series armoured of vehicles, which is based on the new-generation 7 Series and its all-electric i7 counterpart. Dubbed the , these two full-size luxury sedans will be unveiled to the public at this year’s Munich motor show in September ahead of customer deliveries starting in December. The BMW i7 Protection marks the first time the German carmaker has offered an armoured all-electric car. At this stage it’ll be for the European market only. For more Motoring related news and videos check out BMW claims these armoured models were factored into the development of the new 7 Series range. It also claims they offer “major advantages” over armoured a finished vehicle at a later date. The largest change on the BMW 7 Series and i7 Protection models is the supporting structure of the car is made from armour steel. This creates the so-called BMW Protection Core. Other changes include protection-spec doors, armoured underbody, safety glass, self-sealing fuel tank. Both models come fitted with 20-inch alloy wheels wrapped in specially developed Michelin run-flat tyres that can be driven at up to 80km/h without any air pressure. The 7 Series and i7 Protection are also available with a wide range of options including a fresh-air supply system, a fire extinguisher with automatic and manual discharge, flashing lights, radio transceivers and flag poles. In terms of credentials, the BMW 7 Series and i7 Protection offers class VR9 protection based on the Germany’s Association of Test Laboratories for Attack-Resistant Materials and Constructions (VPAM). As part of the certification process, BMW claims the “special protection elements” have to demonstrate their ability to resist attack by “undergoing a demanding procedure”. Experts from an independent testing institute also conduct firearms and explosive tests on the vehicle. The glass on the two models is even claimed to protect against gunfire from calibre 7.6×54 R ammunition. Although BMW hasn’t stated how much extra weight the 7 Series and i7 Protection have gained, it claims to have optimised the amount added compared to its predecessors. This means it’s claimed to have a higher load-carrying capacity and increased body rigidity. The BMW 7 Series Protection is powered by a 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine with a 48V mild-hybrid system that produces system outputs of 390kW of power and 750Nm of torque. Drive is sent through an xDrive all-wheel drive system. BMW claims the 7 Series Protection can do the 0-100km/h sprint in 6.6 seconds, which is 2.4 seconds slower than the equivalent 760i xDrive. Flat out you’ll be doing 210km/h. The all-electric BMW i7 Protection on the other hand is powered by a version of the dual-motor all-wheel drive setup in the recently revealed i7 M70 xDrive, with system outputs of 400kW and 745Nm. It’s claimed this model can do the 0-100km/h sprint in 9.0 seconds, which is 5.3 seconds slower than the actual i7 M70 xDrive. Top speed is electronically limited to 160km/h. Despite their armoured bodies, the 7 Series and i7 Protection still offer a properly luxurious interior. There’s a standard 28-speaker Bowers & Wilkins surround sound system, intercom, powered opening and closing doors, and electric roller sunblinds for the rear windows, among others. Customers can option items like a cool box that’s integrated between the two rear seats which has an eight-litre capacity and can be cooled to 4 or 10 degrees Celsius. There are also a range of upholstery and interior surfaces that carry over from the “richly varied options list” of the new BMW 7 Series. BMW has been producing armoured vehicles for 45 years now. It has historically used flagship 7 Series sedan’s as the base but in recent history has also started using the X5 SUV. MORE:",

            "content": "Welcome to your five-minute recap of the trading day, and how experts saw it. The numbers The Australian sharemarket managed to shake off a dreary start to the day by gaining ground despite Wall Street’s worries about the banking system and global economy. CBA shares lifted after the nation’s biggest bank revealed a record $10.2 billion profit . The S&P/ASX 200 closed Wednesday’s session up 26.9 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 7338 points, as financial, communication and tech stocks kept the bourse in the green. Wall Street finished the day lower, but the ASX was still able to record a positive session. Credit: AP The lifters Funeral services firm InvoCare was the best performer of the day, gaining 5.9 per cent after its board agreed to its $1.8 billion takeover by private equity firm TPG. In second place was Coronado Global Resources (up 4.8 per cent), followed by ultrasound tech company Nanosonics (up 3.9 per cent). The laggards Lithium producer Lake Resources wound up at the bottom of the bourse, sliding 5.7 per cent. Medical equipment supplier Resmed lost 4.6 per cent and jewellery chain Lovisa was 4.3 per cent lower. The lowdown Commonwealth Bank chief executive Matt Comyn. Earnings season is officially in full swing: major banks dominated the headlines on Wednesday, with both CBA and Suncorp revealing their figures for the 2023 financial year. Commonwealth Bank shares closed 2.6 per cent higher after the lender posted its result and revealed it will lift its dividend even at a time of increased risks from the rise in the cost of living and higher interest rates. “The Australian economy has been resilient with the tailwinds of a recovery in population growth, relatively high commodity prices and low unemployment,” CBA chief Matt Comyn said in a statement. Comyn had a pay rise of more than $3 million, with the bank boss’s total pay rising from almost $7 million to $10.4 million in the latest financial year as he received bonus shares linked to the bank’s long-term performance. Loading The other big four banks also finished in the green: NAB lifted 2.2 per cent, Westpac 1.7 per cent and ANZ gained 0.8 per cent. Market heavyweights Rio Tinto slid 0.5 per cent, while BHP gained 0.4 per cent. Suncorp’s share price finished 1.5 per cent lower after the insurer said car and home insurance premiums had increased at double-digit rates, and flagged more price rises. Suncorp, the company behind insurance brands including AAMI and GIO, reported a sharp turnaround in its profits, with net profit of $1.15 billion, up from $681 million last year. In its Australian insurance division, profits jumped 334 per cent to $755 million, reflecting premium growth, higher returns on its investment portfolio, and lower costs. Loading Kerry Stokes-backed energy outfit Beach Energy recovered some ground after sliding more than 2 per cent early on Wednesday. It closed 0.3 per cent lower as investors digested the news of its newly appointed new chief executive, Brett Woods, an executive vice-president at Santos. Woods replaces Morne Engelbrecht, who has been in the job about two years. Although the market hasn’t reacted positively to the news, Royal Bank of Canada market analyst Gordon Ramsay said the change of guard was a good thing, assigning “positive” sentiment to the move and describing Woods as having “strong energy industry operational experience”. Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent and at one point was down nearly triple that. The loss was its fifth in the past six days after the index rocketed through the year’s first seven months. The Dow Jones retreated by 0.4 per cent and the Nasdaq lost 0.8 per cent. Stocks of US banks fell after Moody’s cut the credit ratings for 10 smaller and midsized lenders. It cited a list of concerns about their financial strength, from the effects of higher interest rates to the trend of working from home that is leaving office buildings vacant. Across the Pacific, stocks sank after a report showed exports for China’s troubled economy shrank by the most since the start of the pandemic in 2020. And in Europe, bank stocks dropped after Italy’s cabinet approved a proposal to tax a chunk of their profits this year. The worries layered on top of a mixed set of earnings reports from big US companies. Tweet of the day Quote of the day “Our focus on sustainable performance has underpinned another year of good outcomes for our customers and stakeholders, and that is reflected in executive remuneration outcomes.“ That was Commonwealth Bank non-executive director Simon Moutter, who chairs the board’s people and remuneration committee .

        "description": "Researchers evaluates the nutritional profiles of plant-based dairy alternatives.",
        "content": "A recent study published in Nutrients evaluates the nutritional profiles of plant-based dairy alternatives and found satisfactory macronutrient composition despite lower protein levels. Study: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Nutritional Composition of Plant-Based Drinks and Yogurt Alternatives in Europe . Image Credit: Oksana Mizina / Shutterstock.com The current human food system has many negative impacts on human health, planetary health, and animal well-being. Some of the concerns associated with the food system include the risk of zoonotic diseases, global warming, land use change, loss of biodiversity, and excessive agricultural usage of freshwater. The development of a sustainable food system by shifting from animal- to plant-based dietary habits has become the primary focus of the international community to reduce the negative impact of a carnivorous diet on the environment. Plant-based dairy alternatives, including plant-based drinks and yogurt products, are gaining popularity as more sustainable dairy options. Plant-based dairy alternatives are based on various plant ingredients, including legumes, grains, nuts, and seeds. National food-based dietary guidelines have started including unflavored and fortified soy-based dairy alternatives alongside dairy products. In the current study, scientists compare the nutritional composition of currently available plant-based dairy alternatives with their dairy counterparts throughout Europe. The study included three types of plant-based dairy alternatives currently available in Europe, including plant-based drinks, plant-based yogurt alternatives, and Greek-style plant-based yogurt alternatives that have a higher protein content and thicker consistency than conventional yogurt products. The nutritional composition of branded items was collected from the manufacturers’ websites. Supermarket websites were checked for private retailer labels. The nutritional database Open Food Facts was used when primary website-derived information was not adequate. The official national food databases were used to assess the nutritional composition of dairy milk and yogurt. A total of 27 brands from 30 European countries, as well as 16 private labels from seven European countries, were included in the analysis. The nutritional analysis was conducted on a total of 249 plant-based drinks, 52 plant-based yogurt alternatives, and eight Greek-style plant-based yogurt alternatives. Most plant-based dairy alternatives were composed of a single ingredient base, including soy, oat, almond, coconut, or rice. About 13% of plant-based drinks were labeled as “other,” which included both mixed and single ingredient bases. In addition, 38% of plant-based drinks and 25% of plant-based yogurt alternatives were categorized as “organic.” In terms of energy content, the highest values were obtained from rice, oat, and “other” plant-based drinks. In contrast, almond and coconut plant-based drinks exhibited the lowest energy content. A significant variation in energy content was observed between plant-based yogurts depending on the ingredient bases. A significantly higher energy content was observed in coconut-based yogurts as compared to soy-based and dairy yogurts. Both Greek-style plant-based, and dairy yogurts had similar energy profiles. The lowest fat content was observed in rice-based drinks. Soy-based drinks had significantly higher fat content than almond, oat, rice, and dairy drinks. Similarly, coconut-based yogurt had higher fat content than soy, oat, and dairy yogurts. Both Greek-style plant-based, and dairy yogurts had similar fat content. All plant-based drinks, except those with coconut, had saturated fat content lower than low-fat dairy milks. A similar trend was observed for plant-based and Greek-style plant-based yogurts. Only soy-based drinks and yogurts had protein content comparable to dairy products. All Greek-style plant-based yogurts, except for four items with soy, had lower protein content than dairy yogurts. All plant-based drinks, except rice-based drinks, had lower sugar content than dairy milk. Except for soy-based yogurts, which had lower sugar content, all other plant-based yogurts had comparable sugar content as dairy yogurts. Both Greek-style plant-based and dairy yogurts had similar sugar content. Regarding fiber content, five plant-based drinks containing soy, almond, pistachio, oat, and oat with hazelnut, as well as two plant-based yogurts consisting of coconut and soy, had satisfactory fiber content, which was equivalent to 16-24% of recommended intakes. All other plant-based dairy alternatives were low in fiber. Micronutrient fortification was observed in most non-organic plant-based dairy alternatives, with calcium being the most commonly fortified micronutrient. Organic plant-based dairy alternatives lacked micronutrient fortification because of legal restrictions. Among non-organic plant-based dairy alternatives, 76% were fortified with calcium, 66% with vitamin D, and 60% with vitamin B12. Vitamin B2, iodine, and vitamin A fortification was observed in approximately 50%, 11%, and 6% of plant-based dairy alternatives, respectively. Overall, micronutrient fortification was less commonly observed for plant-based yogurts as compared to that for plant-based drinks. Plant-based dairy alternatives have favorable nutritional profiles despite lower protein content. Based on the study findings, the scientists recommend including fortified plant-based dairy alternatives in food-based dietary guidelines as more environmentally sustainable food options for a healthy population. Increased fortification with vital dairy-related micronutrients would also effectively improve the nutritional quality of plant-based dairy alternatives.",

It has to be said that he repaid the faith by his performances throughout the season. Stokes scored 316 runs in 12 matches at a strike rate of 142.98 where 103* was his highest score. As a bowler, he scalped 12 wickets at an economy of 7.18. When Ben Stokes Spent £1.7 Million On Lavish Durham Home Stokes, who plays county cricket for Durham, perhaps saw it as a perfect opportunity to buy a house there itself. It is a five-bedroom home which is made on a 2.2-acre property. There are all the luxurious amenities with a spiral staircase and stone flooring. The mansion even has a triple garage with a one-bedroom self-contained apartment above it, that has its own living room and shower room. The dining area has a breakfast bar along with a lounge sitting area. There are two large sofas as well in the living room for comfortable sitting during entertainment sessions. Presumably delighted at buying such a luxurious home, Stokes even thanked his property agent for helping him throughout on social media platform Twitter. Who Was The Previous Owner Of Ben Stokes’ Durham Home? Readers must note that Stokes had purchased the property from former footballer Adam Johnson. Having played for teams such as Manchester City, Sunderland, etc. in the past, Johnson had put the house on sale for a price of £1.85 million. Stokes, however, got it at a discounted price of £1.7 million. It was exactly the same amount that Stokes earned from his IPL 2017 stint. Johnson was sentenced to prison for six years and that’s why he decided to sell his house on an urgent basis. With him not being able to appeal against the verdict by the court, the urgency resulted in a discount for Stokes. Advertisement For the unversed, Johnson was guilty of engaging in a sexual activity with a 15-year-old female fan. The former footballer used to live in the Durham home with his ex-girlfriend and daughter named Ayla. He had bought the home for £1.57 million in 2012. Advertisement",

        "content": "Israel’s Supreme Court is hearing the first in a series of appeals against a judicial overhaul being unfurled by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his religious-nationalist coalition, which has set off an unprecedented domestic crisis. A March amendment to a quasi-constitutional “basic law” limited conditions under which a prime minister can be deemed unfit, or incapacitated, and removed from office. The appellants – backed by Mr Netanyahu’s own attorney-general – want that voided. The case being heard by three justices pits the Supreme Court against the Knesset, or parliament, situated shouting distance away across a rose garden on a gentle Jerusalem hill. “Clash Among Branches of Government – The First Test”, read the main headline of the mass-circulation daily Israel Hayom . Supporters of Mr Netanyahu, who bounded back to a record sixth term in late December, cast Thursday’s appeal – and others slated for next month – as a reminder of what they deem meddling by unelected judges in the democratic mandate of the coalition. Critics see the Supreme Court as the last check on an executive working in lock-step with the legislature in a country that has no formal constitution. That Mr Netanyahu is on trial in three graft cases has further fuelled worries at home and abroad for Israel’s democratic health. He denies any wrongdoing and has cast the criminal charges against him as a politicised witch hunt. “There’s a desire here to create a judicial dictatorship,” Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told public broadcaster Kan. The appellant Movement for Quality Government in Israel argues the March law “constituted another transition toward dictatorship” and “set a dangerous new precedent (whereby) the person possessing the premiership can change constitutional arrangements as convenient given the majority he has to hand”. On September 12, for the first time in Israel, the entire 15-justice bench will convene to hear an appeal against another basic law amendment – this one curbing Supreme Court powers. The legislation, ratified on July 24, removed the “reasonableness” standard of review which was among the court’s tools to overrule government decisions. Critics of that amendment worry that it will encourage high-level corruption. Both the incapacity and reasonableness amendments are part of basic laws the court so far has refrained from quashing. Mr Netanyahu has voiced hope it will not do so now and has been hazy on whether he would abide by any such ruling. -Reuters",

Watch the latest news and stream for free on Melissa’s mother Suzanne Poll was just 36 when she was found in a pool of blood in the rear of the Adelaide stationery store where she worked in 1993. She had suffered at least 18 stab wounds, including some that went right through her body. Melissa was eight-years-old at the time. Suzanne also left behind a son named Adam. The case remained unsolved until 2019, when new DNA technology led police to Matthew Donald Tilley through a discarded takeaway coffee cup. His DNA was matched to blood found at the murder scene. Tilley was jailed for at least 26 years over the killing. When he was convicted, Melissa told 7NEWS it was the best Christmas present she could have wished for. Her family said they are still coming to terms with her death and are supporting her husband and children. Tilley had argued errors were made during his trial in relation to the admission of DNA evidence, the judge’s directions to the jury on motive and in relation to forensic and other material. He also contended the jury had received an unbalanced summary of the case. But in a judgement on Thursday, the Court of Appeal dismissed his challenge. It found the judge’s directions were not inadequate, he had not erred in allowing certain evidence and there had been no miscarriage of justice. “When considered in its entirety, the trial judge’s summing up was not unbalanced,” the appeal court said. “Nor did His Honour fail to adequately and fairly present the defence case.” It’s an emotional time for the family, Melissa’s aunt Barbara Taylor said. “It’s devastating and wonderful at the same time,” she said. “It’s been 30 years and we’ve finally got the result that we wanted. The appeal has been dismissed. “But on the other hand, it’s devastating news that my beautiful niece Melissa passed away last night, and she wasn’t around to share the wonderful news.” The DNA evidence was a key sticking point of Tilley’s trial, with his defence questioning whether the evidence had been properly preserved over almost three decades. In sentencing, Justice David Peek said Tilley’s continued denials of killing Suzanne were knowingly false. “You fled the scene and have been successful in evading police detection for many years,” the judge told him. “You continue, even now, to falsely deny your guilt, and you decline to offer any explanation as to how your conduct came about.”",

        "content": "star Ryan Papenhuyzen is poised to return to rugby league after a year on the sidelines following his horrific knee injury. The flying fullback will take to the field for feeder club the Sunshine Coast Falcons on Saturday after almost 13 months out with a shattered knee cap. Watch the latest sport on Channel 7 or stream for free on , with his return to rugby league taking 384 days. The 25-year-old suffered numerous setbacks during his recovery and . Papenhuyzen has been increasing his training workload in recent weeks as he pushes for a return to the Storm team ahead of the finals. Ahead of Melbourne’s Friday night blockbuster with the Panthers, Storm coach Craig Bellamy revealed the plan for the star fullback was to take it slow and steady and gradually increase his playing minutes. “I just want to see him get through the 55 minutes or 50 minutes, whatever he plays, strongly without any more problems with his knee,” Bellamy told the media. “That’s all we’re after. It’s a plan for this week and then we’ll see what happens from there, we’re not going to rush anything. “He’s certainly down (to play) for this week, he probably won’t play 80 minutes. “If he gets through the game, we’ll reassess where he’s at medically and where he’s at footy wise and physically as well. “We will plan for next week after that.” Bellamy said the Storm would love to have their exciting fullback make a return for the finals; however, the club was prepared to continue to play without him. “We’d love to have him back at the end of the year, but if he’s not ready, then we won’t do it,” Bellamy said. “We’ve played the patience game and he’s played the patience game and we’ll keep playing that just to get him through the first three, four, five weeks, which are going to be very important.” Papenhuyzen said he was looking forward to getting back on the field as he pushed for a return to the NRL. “It hasn’t really sunk in yet, so I’m sort of just going through the training week and trying to prepare like it’s a normal game,” Papenhuyzen said about his return to rugby league. “It’s just been a while between drinks. It’s had its ups and downs and setbacks, and it’s probably taken a little bit longer than expected but at the same time I’m happy I did that. “It’s been long enough now that I feel ready, and I guess that’s the main thing about long-term rehab is that resistance to being ready. “There are so many people to thank, and I’ll probably save that for another day, but I think it’s a big milestone and I need to celebrate the small wins along the way, and this is another one of them. “It’s a big step to be back after such a significant injury. I want to be playing NRL, so I have a little bit to go to achieve the goals I want — I’ve just got to keep doing the work.”",

        "content": "The findings from an independent inquiry into the justice system’s handling of Brittany Higgins’ rape allegation will be released early after it was given to some media outlets without authorisation. The ACT government had planned to take time to consider the findings before publication but after extensive media reporting it will be released next week along with an interim response. A spokeswoman said the government was “disappointed” the board of inquiry report had been released to select media outlets under embargo, a decision that was not authorised by the territory administration. She said in a statement the unauthorised release of information had harmed people involved. The government will continue its cabinet process to consider the report’s recommendations. The inquiry was headed by former Supreme Court judge Walter Sofronoff and delivered its report to the ACT government on July 31. Mr Sofronoff declined to comment when contacted by AAP. The ACT government has faced pressure from the opposition and after media outlets published its findings. The head of the Australian Federal Police Association said that reporting had vindicated his officers over their roles in the rape investigation. “While we welcomed the inquiry, we knew it would be the only way to reveal the truth,” Alex Caruana said. “We were always confident that the investigating officers had conducted a thorough and professional investigation from day one.” Mr Caruana said the government should also consider investigating who leaked the report. , who oversaw the court case against Ms Higgins’ accused rapist Bruce Lehrmann. Mr Lehrmann was charged with raping his fellow Liberal staffer at Parliament House after a night out in 2019, but he denies the allegations. His trial was aborted due to juror misconduct and prosecutors later dropped the charge over fears about the impact of a second trial on Ms Higgins’ mental health. Mr Drumgold has taken leave until the end of the month while the government considers the findings. The ACT government spokeswoman said the territory’s attorney-general had been in contact with the prosecutor about the inquiry findings that related to him. Mr Drumgold told the inquiry he believed police had a “passion” for the prosecution to fail based on a series of “strange events” during the investigation and trial. But despite calling for an inquiry on that basis, Mr Drumgold later conceded his original belief might actually have been due to a “skills deficit” on the part of police. The inquiry revealed confusion within the police force about when to charge a suspect. ACT Liberal leader Elizabeth Lee said there was no justification for Chief Minister Andrew Barr to keep the report under wraps. “Andrew Barr and (Attorney-General) Shane Rattenbury must demonstrate leadership and ministerial responsibility for these findings,” she said. Mr Lehrmann wrote on his Instagram account the report had revealed what he and his legal team suspected, exposing a “dark chapter for the ACT justice system”.",
