        "description": "Researchers evaluates the nutritional profiles of plant-based dairy alternatives.",
        "content": "A recent study published in Nutrients evaluates the nutritional profiles of plant-based dairy alternatives and found satisfactory macronutrient composition despite lower protein levels. Study: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Nutritional Composition of Plant-Based Drinks and Yogurt Alternatives in Europe . Image Credit: Oksana Mizina / Shutterstock.com The current human food system has many negative impacts on human health, planetary health, and animal well-being. Some of the concerns associated with the food system include the risk of zoonotic diseases, global warming, land use change, loss of biodiversity, and excessive agricultural usage of freshwater. The development of a sustainable food system by shifting from animal- to plant-based dietary habits has become the primary focus of the international community to reduce the negative impact of a carnivorous diet on the environment. Plant-based dairy alternatives, including plant-based drinks and yogurt products, are gaining popularity as more sustainable dairy options. Plant-based dairy alternatives are based on various plant ingredients, including legumes, grains, nuts, and seeds. National food-based dietary guidelines have started including unflavored and fortified soy-based dairy alternatives alongside dairy products. In the current study, scientists compare the nutritional composition of currently available plant-based dairy alternatives with their dairy counterparts throughout Europe. The study included three types of plant-based dairy alternatives currently available in Europe, including plant-based drinks, plant-based yogurt alternatives, and Greek-style plant-based yogurt alternatives that have a higher protein content and thicker consistency than conventional yogurt products. The nutritional composition of branded items was collected from the manufacturers’ websites. Supermarket websites were checked for private retailer labels. The nutritional database Open Food Facts was used when primary website-derived information was not adequate. The official national food databases were used to assess the nutritional composition of dairy milk and yogurt. A total of 27 brands from 30 European countries, as well as 16 private labels from seven European countries, were included in the analysis. The nutritional analysis was conducted on a total of 249 plant-based drinks, 52 plant-based yogurt alternatives, and eight Greek-style plant-based yogurt alternatives. Most plant-based dairy alternatives were composed of a single ingredient base, including soy, oat, almond, coconut, or rice. About 13% of plant-based drinks were labeled as “other,” which included both mixed and single ingredient bases. In addition, 38% of plant-based drinks and 25% of plant-based yogurt alternatives were categorized as “organic.” In terms of energy content, the highest values were obtained from rice, oat, and “other” plant-based drinks. In contrast, almond and coconut plant-based drinks exhibited the lowest energy content. A significant variation in energy content was observed between plant-based yogurts depending on the ingredient bases. A significantly higher energy content was observed in coconut-based yogurts as compared to soy-based and dairy yogurts. Both Greek-style plant-based, and dairy yogurts had similar energy profiles. The lowest fat content was observed in rice-based drinks. Soy-based drinks had significantly higher fat content than almond, oat, rice, and dairy drinks. Similarly, coconut-based yogurt had higher fat content than soy, oat, and dairy yogurts. Both Greek-style plant-based, and dairy yogurts had similar fat content. All plant-based drinks, except those with coconut, had saturated fat content lower than low-fat dairy milks. A similar trend was observed for plant-based and Greek-style plant-based yogurts. Only soy-based drinks and yogurts had protein content comparable to dairy products. All Greek-style plant-based yogurts, except for four items with soy, had lower protein content than dairy yogurts. All plant-based drinks, except rice-based drinks, had lower sugar content than dairy milk. Except for soy-based yogurts, which had lower sugar content, all other plant-based yogurts had comparable sugar content as dairy yogurts. Both Greek-style plant-based and dairy yogurts had similar sugar content. Regarding fiber content, five plant-based drinks containing soy, almond, pistachio, oat, and oat with hazelnut, as well as two plant-based yogurts consisting of coconut and soy, had satisfactory fiber content, which was equivalent to 16-24% of recommended intakes. All other plant-based dairy alternatives were low in fiber. Micronutrient fortification was observed in most non-organic plant-based dairy alternatives, with calcium being the most commonly fortified micronutrient. Organic plant-based dairy alternatives lacked micronutrient fortification because of legal restrictions. Among non-organic plant-based dairy alternatives, 76% were fortified with calcium, 66% with vitamin D, and 60% with vitamin B12. Vitamin B2, iodine, and vitamin A fortification was observed in approximately 50%, 11%, and 6% of plant-based dairy alternatives, respectively. Overall, micronutrient fortification was less commonly observed for plant-based yogurts as compared to that for plant-based drinks. Plant-based dairy alternatives have favorable nutritional profiles despite lower protein content. Based on the study findings, the scientists recommend including fortified plant-based dairy alternatives in food-based dietary guidelines as more environmentally sustainable food options for a healthy population. Increased fortification with vital dairy-related micronutrients would also effectively improve the nutritional quality of plant-based dairy alternatives.",

        "content": "Been an all-format player for England by then, all-rounder celebrated becoming a millionaire in what was his maiden Indian Premier League auction by buying a lavish home in Durham. As if Stokes was waiting for such a high-cost deal, he opted to spend his entire IPL contract amount on the same six years ago. Advertisement Stokes, who had registered himself in the auction at a base price of INR 2 crore, fetched a lot of interest as was on the expected lines. , , (then Daredevils), and were all after him. In the end, Pune acquired his services at a whopping price of INR 14.5 crore (around £1.7 million) in February 2017. “He’s a complete player. He completes our squad. We’ve been lacking this genre of player. We have many heroes, but this is one hero we were lacking. We knew he was going to go expensive,” Sanjeev Goenka, owner of Supergiants, had said after buying Stokes. Advertisement Stokes was the most expensive player of the auction that year. It has to be said that he repaid the faith by his performances throughout the season. Stokes scored 316 runs in 12 matches at a strike rate of 142.98 where 103* was his highest score. As a bowler, he scalped 12 wickets at an economy of 7.18. When Ben Stokes Spent £1.7 Million On Lavish Durham Home Stokes, who plays county cricket for Durham, perhaps saw it as a perfect opportunity to buy a house there itself. It is a five-bedroom home which is made on a 2.2-acre property. There are all the luxurious amenities with a spiral staircase and stone flooring. The mansion even has a triple garage with a one-bedroom self-contained apartment above it, that has its own living room and shower room. The dining area has a breakfast bar along with a lounge sitting area. There are two large sofas as well in the living room for comfortable sitting during entertainment sessions. Presumably delighted at buying such a luxurious home, Stokes even thanked his property agent for helping him throughout on social media platform Twitter. Who Was The Previous Owner Of Ben Stokes’ Durham Home? Readers must note that Stokes had purchased the property from former footballer Adam Johnson. Having played for teams such as Manchester City, Sunderland, etc. in the past, Johnson had put the house on sale for a price of £1.85 million. Stokes, however, got it at a discounted price of £1.7 million. It was exactly the same amount that Stokes earned from his IPL 2017 stint. Johnson was sentenced to prison for six years and that’s why he decided to sell his house on an urgent basis. With him not being able to appeal against the verdict by the court, the urgency resulted in a discount for Stokes. Advertisement For the unversed, Johnson was guilty of engaging in a sexual activity with a 15-year-old female fan. The former footballer used to live in the Durham home with his ex-girlfriend and daughter named Ayla. He had bought the home for £1.57 million in 2012. Advertisement",

        "content": "Israel’s Supreme Court is hearing the first in a series of appeals against a judicial overhaul being unfurled by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his religious-nationalist coalition, which has set off an unprecedented domestic crisis. A March amendment to a quasi-constitutional “basic law” limited conditions under which a prime minister can be deemed unfit, or incapacitated, and removed from office. The appellants – backed by Mr Netanyahu’s own attorney-general – want that voided. The case being heard by three justices pits the Supreme Court against the Knesset, or parliament, situated shouting distance away across a rose garden on a gentle Jerusalem hill. “Clash Among Branches of Government – The First Test”, read the main headline of the mass-circulation daily Israel Hayom . Supporters of Mr Netanyahu, who bounded back to a record sixth term in late December, cast Thursday’s appeal – and others slated for next month – as a reminder of what they deem meddling by unelected judges in the democratic mandate of the coalition. Critics see the Supreme Court as the last check on an executive working in lock-step with the legislature in a country that has no formal constitution. That Mr Netanyahu is on trial in three graft cases has further fuelled worries at home and abroad for Israel’s democratic health. He denies any wrongdoing and has cast the criminal charges against him as a politicised witch hunt. “There’s a desire here to create a judicial dictatorship,” Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told public broadcaster Kan. The appellant Movement for Quality Government in Israel argues the March law “constituted another transition toward dictatorship” and “set a dangerous new precedent (whereby) the person possessing the premiership can change constitutional arrangements as convenient given the majority he has to hand”. On September 12, for the first time in Israel, the entire 15-justice bench will convene to hear an appeal against another basic law amendment – this one curbing Supreme Court powers. The legislation, ratified on July 24, removed the “reasonableness” standard of review which was among the court’s tools to overrule government decisions. Critics of that amendment worry that it will encourage high-level corruption. Both the incapacity and reasonableness amendments are part of basic laws the court so far has refrained from quashing. Mr Netanyahu has voiced hope it will not do so now and has been hazy on whether he would abide by any such ruling. -Reuters",

Watch the latest news and stream for free on Melissa’s mother Suzanne Poll was just 36 when she was found in a pool of blood in the rear of the Adelaide stationery store where she worked in 1993. She had suffered at least 18 stab wounds, including some that went right through her body. Melissa was eight-years-old at the time. Suzanne also left behind a son named Adam. The case remained unsolved until 2019, when new DNA technology led police to Matthew Donald Tilley through a discarded takeaway coffee cup. His DNA was matched to blood found at the murder scene. Tilley was jailed for at least 26 years over the killing. When he was convicted, Melissa told 7NEWS it was the best Christmas present she could have wished for. Her family said they are still coming to terms with her death and are supporting her husband and children. Tilley had argued errors were made during his trial in relation to the admission of DNA evidence, the judge’s directions to the jury on motive and in relation to forensic and other material. He also contended the jury had received an unbalanced summary of the case. But in a judgement on Thursday, the Court of Appeal dismissed his challenge. It found the judge’s directions were not inadequate, he had not erred in allowing certain evidence and there had been no miscarriage of justice. “When considered in its entirety, the trial judge’s summing up was not unbalanced,” the appeal court said. “Nor did His Honour fail to adequately and fairly present the defence case.” It’s an emotional time for the family, Melissa’s aunt Barbara Taylor said. “It’s devastating and wonderful at the same time,” she said. “It’s been 30 years and we’ve finally got the result that we wanted. The appeal has been dismissed. “But on the other hand, it’s devastating news that my beautiful niece Melissa passed away last night, and she wasn’t around to share the wonderful news.” The DNA evidence was a key sticking point of Tilley’s trial, with his defence questioning whether the evidence had been properly preserved over almost three decades. In sentencing, Justice David Peek said Tilley’s continued denials of killing Suzanne were knowingly false. “You fled the scene and have been successful in evading police detection for many years,” the judge told him. “You continue, even now, to falsely deny your guilt, and you decline to offer any explanation as to how your conduct came about.”",

        "content": "star Ryan Papenhuyzen is poised to return to rugby league after a year on the sidelines following his horrific knee injury. The flying fullback will take to the field for feeder club the Sunshine Coast Falcons on Saturday after almost 13 months out with a shattered knee cap. Watch the latest sport on Channel 7 or stream for free on , with his return to rugby league taking 384 days. The 25-year-old suffered numerous setbacks during his recovery and . Papenhuyzen has been increasing his training workload in recent weeks as he pushes for a return to the Storm team ahead of the finals. Ahead of Melbourne’s Friday night blockbuster with the Panthers, Storm coach Craig Bellamy revealed the plan for the star fullback was to take it slow and steady and gradually increase his playing minutes. “I just want to see him get through the 55 minutes or 50 minutes, whatever he plays, strongly without any more problems with his knee,” Bellamy told the media. “That’s all we’re after. It’s a plan for this week and then we’ll see what happens from there, we’re not going to rush anything. “He’s certainly down (to play) for this week, he probably won’t play 80 minutes. “If he gets through the game, we’ll reassess where he’s at medically and where he’s at footy wise and physically as well. “We will plan for next week after that.” Bellamy said the Storm would love to have their exciting fullback make a return for the finals; however, the club was prepared to continue to play without him. “We’d love to have him back at the end of the year, but if he’s not ready, then we won’t do it,” Bellamy said. “We’ve played the patience game and he’s played the patience game and we’ll keep playing that just to get him through the first three, four, five weeks, which are going to be very important.” Papenhuyzen said he was looking forward to getting back on the field as he pushed for a return to the NRL. “It hasn’t really sunk in yet, so I’m sort of just going through the training week and trying to prepare like it’s a normal game,” Papenhuyzen said about his return to rugby league. “It’s just been a while between drinks. It’s had its ups and downs and setbacks, and it’s probably taken a little bit longer than expected but at the same time I’m happy I did that. “It’s been long enough now that I feel ready, and I guess that’s the main thing about long-term rehab is that resistance to being ready. “There are so many people to thank, and I’ll probably save that for another day, but I think it’s a big milestone and I need to celebrate the small wins along the way, and this is another one of them. “It’s a big step to be back after such a significant injury. I want to be playing NRL, so I have a little bit to go to achieve the goals I want — I’ve just got to keep doing the work.”",

        "content": "The findings from an independent inquiry into the justice system’s handling of Brittany Higgins’ rape allegation will be released early after it was given to some media outlets without authorisation. The ACT government had planned to take time to consider the findings before publication but after extensive media reporting it will be released next week along with an interim response. A spokeswoman said the government was “disappointed” the board of inquiry report had been released to select media outlets under embargo, a decision that was not authorised by the territory administration. She said in a statement the unauthorised release of information had harmed people involved. The government will continue its cabinet process to consider the report’s recommendations. The inquiry was headed by former Supreme Court judge Walter Sofronoff and delivered its report to the ACT government on July 31. Mr Sofronoff declined to comment when contacted by AAP. The ACT government has faced pressure from the opposition and after media outlets published its findings. The head of the Australian Federal Police Association said that reporting had vindicated his officers over their roles in the rape investigation. “While we welcomed the inquiry, we knew it would be the only way to reveal the truth,” Alex Caruana said. “We were always confident that the investigating officers had conducted a thorough and professional investigation from day one.” Mr Caruana said the government should also consider investigating who leaked the report. , who oversaw the court case against Ms Higgins’ accused rapist Bruce Lehrmann. Mr Lehrmann was charged with raping his fellow Liberal staffer at Parliament House after a night out in 2019, but he denies the allegations. His trial was aborted due to juror misconduct and prosecutors later dropped the charge over fears about the impact of a second trial on Ms Higgins’ mental health. Mr Drumgold has taken leave until the end of the month while the government considers the findings. The ACT government spokeswoman said the territory’s attorney-general had been in contact with the prosecutor about the inquiry findings that related to him. Mr Drumgold told the inquiry he believed police had a “passion” for the prosecution to fail based on a series of “strange events” during the investigation and trial. But despite calling for an inquiry on that basis, Mr Drumgold later conceded his original belief might actually have been due to a “skills deficit” on the part of police. The inquiry revealed confusion within the police force about when to charge a suspect. ACT Liberal leader Elizabeth Lee said there was no justification for Chief Minister Andrew Barr to keep the report under wraps. “Andrew Barr and (Attorney-General) Shane Rattenbury must demonstrate leadership and ministerial responsibility for these findings,” she said. Mr Lehrmann wrote on his Instagram account the report had revealed what he and his legal team suspected, exposing a “dark chapter for the ACT justice system”.",

Rhetorically asking whether KAJ could score, rebound, run, and pass better than him, Wilt the Stilt openly stated that he was the stronger of the two. Advertisement Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain weren’t always on bad terms. During Abdul-Jabbar’s teenage days, he was a hyped prospect.

Wilt Chamberlain didn’t believe that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was a better player than him Kareem Abdul-Jabbar continued to dominate the NBA hardwood years after Chamberlain’s retirement. Despite Kareem being a far more successful player than him, “The Big Dipper” once claimed that he was the stronger player. Years after being away from the game, the Warriors legend admitted that the six-time NBA champion’s hook shot was the only thing that took the prize. Chamberlain said during an interview back in the day: Advertisement Chamberlain also spoke about a hypothetical one-on-one clash with both players in their prime.
